    "description": "Automatically organizes the positions of vanilla and modded solar system planets to better reflect the Space Age gameplay progression.\n\nThe radial distances of planets are unchanged. Their angles are specified by a number called the 'tier', which can be overridden by the mod author. Tiers run from 0 (north of the star) anticlockwise to 6 (north-east of the star). Mods with no tier appear vertically below the sun. Please suggest a tier for them on Discord!",
